# rake-utilities-for-digital

A repository of Rake tasks to help common processes in digital, including prepping objects for digital collections. 

Each task has an individual `.rake` file in the "rakelib/" directory and is documented in the "docs/" folder following the task's name.

Rake is a automation tool written in Ruby. 
It is a standard part of all Ruby installs, so if you are using Jekyll, you have it installed already.
